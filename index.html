            <h2>Nature and forests</h2>
                <p class="banner">Forests are so much more than a collection of trees. Forests are home to 80% of the world's terrestrial biodiversity.
                    These ecosystems are complex webs of organisms that include plants, animals, fungi and bacteria. Forests take many forms,
                    depending on their latitude, local soil, rainfall and prevailing temperatures.
                    <br>
                <p class="banner">Nature is defined as the natural Earth and the things on it, or the essence of a person or thing. The trees, forests, birds and animals are all an example of nature.</p>
